Laravel To-Do App ( Input Validation and Profile Page )

This is a Laravel-based To-Do application with user authentication and enhanced profile management features. Below are the enhancements and modifications made across the MVC structure of Laravel (Model, View, Controller).

---
Assignment 2 
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implemented the Laravel Fortify package to provide MFA.
- MFA is set to deliver verification codes via email.
- After logging in, users are required to authenticate their identity using a code delivered to their email address.

2. Password Hashing
- Passwords are securely hashed using Laravel's built-in **Hash** facade.
- The application uses Argon2 (configurable via `config/hashing.php`) to ensure strong password encryption.

3. Rate Limiting
- Implemented rate limiting using Laravelâ€™s RateLimiter.
- Login attempts are limited to 3 failed tries before being temporarily disabled to prevent brute force attacks.

Assigmnent 1
Authentication Input Validation
- Implemented **Form Request validation** for the **Login** and **Register** pages.
- Enforced **regex validation rules**:
  - Names only accept alphabets (`A-Z`, `a-z`).
- Custom `FormRequest` classes used:
  - `StoreUserRequest`
  - `LoginUserRequest`

User Profile Features
- Added support to update:
  - Nickname
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - City
  - Password
  - Avatar/Profile picture (with file upload)
- Added option to **delete account** completely.

  - `phone`
  - `city`
