This is a Laravel-based To-Do application with user authentication and enhanced profile management features. Below are the enhancements and modifications made across the MVC structure of Laravel (Model, View, Controller).

Assignment 3
Features
- User Roles: Users are assigned roles (admin or user) stored in the user_roles table.
- Role Permissions: Each role has specific permissions (e.g., Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) stored in the role_permissions table.
- RBAC Enforcement: Buttons and actions in the UI are shown or hidden based on the user's permissions.
- Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage users, activate/deactivate accounts, and view To-Do tasks created by each user.

Database Schema
1. user_roles Table
This table stores the roles assigned to users, including columns for the role ID, user ID, role name, and an optional description.

2. role_permissions Table
This table stores the permissions associated with each role, including columns for the permission ID, role ID, and a description of the permission (e.g., Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete).

RBAC Implementation
1. Middleware for Role Checking
A custom middleware ensures that only users with the correct role can access specific routes. Unauthorized users are redirected to a default page or shown an error.

2. Route Protection
Routes are grouped and protected using middleware. For example, routes for To-Do tasks are accessible only to users with the user role, while admin routes are restricted to users with the admin role.

Authorization Logic
1. Controller Logic
Controllers pass the user's permissions to the Blade views. This ensures that the views can dynamically show or hide buttons and actions based on the user's permissions.

Blade Views
1. index.blade.php
This view displays the list of To-Do items and enforces RBAC for buttons like "New List," "Edit," and "Delete."

2. add.blade.php
This view provides a form for creating a new To-Do item. The form is accessible only to users with the Create permission.

3. dashboard.blade.php
This view serves as the admin dashboard, where admins can manage users and view their To-Do tasks.

Assignment 2 
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implemented the Laravel Fortify package to provide MFA.
- MFA is set to deliver verification codes via email.
- After logging in, users are required to authenticate their identity using a code delivered to their email address.

2. Password Hashing
- Passwords are securely hashed using Laravel's built-in **Hash** facade.
- The application uses Argon2 (configurable via `config/hashing.php`) to ensure strong password encryption.

3. Rate Limiting
- Implemented rate limiting using Laravelâ€™s RateLimiter.
- Login attempts are limited to 3 failed tries before being temporarily disabled to prevent brute force attacks.

  - `StoreUserRequest`
  - `LoginUserRequest`

User Profile Features
- Added support to update:
  - Nickname
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - City
  - Password
  - Avatar/Profile picture (with file upload)
- Added option to **delete account** completely.
